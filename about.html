    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Robotics Software Engineer specializing in autonomy, perception, and planning for robotic systems, 
      with experience in both industry and research. At Vecna Robotics, I contributed to the development of autonomous 
      forklifts and high-reach warehouse robots, focusing on task planning, congestion management, and the design of 
      sensor driver wrappers for lidars and cameras. My work has directly improved warehouse workflows, increased 
      pallet throughput, and enhanced the scalability and reliability of the autonomy stack across multiple platforms.

      Previously, as a Computer Vision Engineer Intern at Vidalign, I built vision pipelines for 3D reconstruction 
      with monocular cameras, improved facial landmark detection, and contributed to real-time 3D mesh generation. 
      During my graduate research at the University of Maryland, I developed novel coverage path planning algorithms, 
      demonstrating improvements in accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods. I also gained experience in 
      machine learning and perception through projects involving neural networks for drug prediction, CNN-based image 
      classification, and OpenCV-based vision tasks such as optical flow, lane detection, and segmentation.

      I hold an M.Eng. in Robotics from the University of Maryland and a B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering from SNDT 
      Women’s University. My technical strengths include C++, Python, ROS, and computer vision frameworks, and I am 
      passionate about designing scalable robotic systems that solve real-world industrial challenges.
