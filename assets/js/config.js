      title: "Traveling Robot Challenge with Charging ",
      subtitle: "Python • Jupyter Notebook",
      description: "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic challenge: given a list of locations, find the shortest route that visits each location exactly once and returns to the start. However, agents cannot simply travel indefinitely in many real-world scenarios, such as electric vehicles (EVs), drones, or robots. Due to their limited battery capacity, they need to be recharged on a regular basis. This variation is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem with Charging (TSP-C): determine the best route that minimizes the overall travel time or distance while also planning charging stops to ensure the vehicle never runs out of fuel.",

      title: "Voronoi Coverage PathPlanning for Sterilization Robots",
      subtitle: "Python",
      description: "For robots employing UV sterilization techniques, it is important to minimize time, overlap, and energy usage while effectively and completely sterilizing interior spaces. This project aims to investigate the hypothesis that under indoor navigation constraints for robots, different coverage path planning techniques, especially standard geometric partitioning and Voronoi partitioning, show certain trade-offs in efficiency and computational costs. To ascertain which technique is more suitable for structured and unstructured spaces in UV sterilization robots, a comparative analysis is conducted.",

      title: "Optical Flow using Lucas-Kanade Algorithm",
      subtitle: "ROS2 • C++ • Navigation",
      description: "The project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the classical Lucas-Kanade optical flow technique for tracking objects in video sequences. Even though the classical Lucas-Kanade tracker provides good performance in terms of small motion variations between consecutive frames under fixed illumination conditions, its performance is compromised in conditions of high motion variations or illumination changes. In the present work, it is investigated whether the conventional optical flow formulation, in conjunction with the pyramidal approach and illumination normalization, improves the robustness of the tracker in real-world perception scenarios for autonomous robots.",
