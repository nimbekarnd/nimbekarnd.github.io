- Developed a **VP-CPP approach** for UV sterilization robots, integrating **Spanning Tree Coverage (STC)** for maximal coverage.
- Benchmarked VP-CPP against **standard CPP**, showing improved accuracy in both uniform and uneven distributions.
- Demonstrated **better time-complexity** than conventional coverage methods.
